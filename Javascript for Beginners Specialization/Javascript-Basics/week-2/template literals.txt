#using backticks in javascript along with $() around your expressions allows you to embed them in your strings.

example:
var incrementor = 0;
var text = "";
while (incrementor < 10){
     text += `The incrementor has gone up to ${incrementor} \n`;
     incrementor++;
}
console.log(text);
the output:
The incrementor has gone up to 0
The incrementor has gone up to 1
The incrementor has gone up to 2
The incrementor has gone up to 3
The incrementor has gone up to 4
The incrementor has gone up to 5
The incrementor has gone up to 6
The incrementor has gone up to 7
The incrementor has gone up to 8
The incrementor has gone up to 9
