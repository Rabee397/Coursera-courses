#One of the most obvious ways to deal with the scope issues is to avoid using global scope as much as possible.

-originally, Javascript was written with the idea that scripts would be very short , so scope was never going to be
 a problem.

-Javascript was originally going to be lightweight scripting langauage , not the full fledged general use programming
langauage it has become.

-it can be easy to write scripts that accidently change the value of a variable in the global scope, leading to difficult
to troubleshoot bugs.(finding variables that hold unexpected values can be challenging and time consuming to troubleshoot).

-if the page loads multiple scripts, variables in the global scope may collide.(it is common to include multiple scripts
 written by different developers in one project).
