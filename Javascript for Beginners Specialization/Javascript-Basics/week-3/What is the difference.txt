What are the differences between these two evennt handlers?

1.document.getElementById("myform").onsubmit = process ;
2.document.getElementById("myform").addEventListener("submit",process);

First:
An element can listen for more than one event when attached via the addEventListener method, but can only have one event 
property on it at a time.

second:
The event listener can be removed via the removeEventListener method , whereas the event property can only be removed by
replacing that event property with a different one.

third:
onsubmit is an event property ,and the addEventListener is a method.
